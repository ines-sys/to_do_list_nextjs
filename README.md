This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the Project

This is a TypeScript/JavaScript logic practice in NextJS styled with Tailwind CSS where I created a list of tasks with local storage, hooks and state management.
